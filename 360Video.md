* Step 1: Use your Richoh Theta S to capture a 360 image.
    * We can find/provide a tutorial on using the Ricoh Theta S.
    * There's a lot of cool, deep content about designing for 360 media and how it works we could include.
        * We could include components on paper prototyping 360 images.

        * Video example: https://youtu.be/7jIaN7wKbZM
        * We could include components on 360 design, which includes notes on human field of view, where to place content to ensure comfort, etc.

        * 360 producers keep the above in mind when deciding how to place objects and events. For example, anything you want users to see comfortably should be roughly within 77 degrees of turning left or right, 40 degrees of up or down. Anything else should really be “bonus” content since the user may never look to see the content.
* Step 2: Upload the 360 image to your computer.
    * We can find/provide a tutorial.
* Step 3: Go to https://360.vizor.io/, then drag and drop your 360 image onto the webpage.
    * We can link to other cool Vizor tools.
* Step 4: Click the “Share” button the top right. Select “Embed” and copy the code.
* Step 5: Paste the “Embed” code into your index.md file at github.com/[username]/[username].github.io, then hit “Commit changes” at the bottom of the page.
    * We can elaborate on what an embed/iframe is.
* Step 6: Visit [username].github.io and your image will be embedded on the page! Hit the “Play” button on the embed, then click and drag to view your image. If you want to view on your phone, visit your portfolio on your phone and click on the image and hit the goggles button.
    * We can do a screen capture/show images.

Potential Extensions

* Prototype a 360 scene. Using an empty grid similar to the picture shown above, students can draw out a 360 scene. If you take a 2D picture of the drawing with a smartphone, you can then upload the 2D picture onto a 360 platform and view in 360. The grid is mapped such that if you follow the rules everything maps to 360 space.
* How does 360 work? Provide a high level explanation of stitching, the process through which multiple 2D images are combined into one 360 image.

* Why did we skip 360 video? Answer: it looks really ugly. A high-level overview of video quality, data compression, data decompression, etc.
* 360 design decisions: arranging your scene, how you can change scale, design do's and don'ts
    * Example Do's: place most of the action in front of your viewer, avoid stitch lines, place the camera somewhere that would make sense for your viewer to embody, orient the camera in the way your user will be oriented
